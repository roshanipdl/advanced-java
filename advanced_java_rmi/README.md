# RMI Price Calculator Application

This is a Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) client-server application that calculates the selling price of an item after applying a discount.

## Problem Statement
Find the selling price of an item with cost price Rs. 34000 after a discount of Rs. 3000.

## Files Description

1. **PriceCalculator.java** - Remote interface defining the contract for price calculation
2. **PriceCalculatorImpl.java** - Implementation of the remote interface
3. **PriceServer.java** - RMI server that hosts the price calculator service
4. **PriceClient.java** - RMI client that connects to the server and performs calculations

## How to Run in IntelliJ

### Step 1: Compile the Project
1. Open IntelliJ IDEA
2. Open this project folder
3. Make sure all Java files are in the same directory
4. Build the project (Build â†’ Build Project)

### Step 2: Start the RMI Registry (Optional)
If you encounter issues, you can manually start the RMI registry:
```bash
rmiregistry 1099
```

### Step 3: Run the Server
1. Right-click on `PriceServer.java`
2. Select "Run 'PriceServer.main()'"
3. You should see: "Price Calculator Server is running..."

### Step 4: Run the Client
1. Right-click on `PriceClient.java`
2. Select "Run 'PriceClient.main()'"
3. You should see the calculation results

## Expected Output

When you run the client, you should see:
```
=== Price Calculation Results ===
Cost Price: Rs. 34000.0
Discount: Rs. 3000.0
Selling Price: Rs. 31000.0
================================
```

## Troubleshooting

1. **Port already in use**: Make sure no other application is using port 1099
2. **Connection refused**: Ensure the server is running before the client
3. **Security manager issues**: The application doesn't require a security manager for local testing

## Calculation Logic

The selling price is calculated as:
```
Selling Price = Cost Price - Discount
Selling Price = 34000 - 3000 = 31000
```
